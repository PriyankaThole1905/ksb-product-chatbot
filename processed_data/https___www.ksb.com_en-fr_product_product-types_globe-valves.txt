in industrial processes and technical procedures enormous heat losses can occur quickly poorly insulated or uninsulated pipe fittings such as globe valves can become the weak point of your system in large plants heat loss multiplies as often thousands of globe valves are installed in such facilities operating reliability and energy efficiency are characteristic features of ksb globe valves being optimally suited for insulation the valves minimise heat loss in industrial processes and technical procedures regardless of whether the fluid flowing through the globe valve is water or a different fluid ksb globe valves are completely maintenancefree globe valve to dinen with flanged ends short facetoface length to en 55814 slanted seat design with vertical bonnet singlepiece body

position indicator seatdisc interface made of wear and corrosion resistant chrome steel or chrome nickel steel globe valves serve to shut off the flow of liquid or gaseous fluids in pipes they can also be used as control valves for shutting off the flow the stem rotates and presses the valve disc against the valve seat for many conventional globe valves the yoke also serves as a type of cooling rib leading to low temperatures at the handwheel the secret behind ksb globe valves its simple we combine an easytoinsulate basic geometry with suitable materials to reduce the flow of heat to this effect we use a heat barrier connected with the handwheel the stem nut and the handwheel are made of poorly heatconducting materials this reduces the thermal conductivity by 75 percent compared to the previous design globe valves from ksb absolutely tight shutoff for even higher efficiency save more than 50 percent of energy with a ksb globe valve benefits of a ksb globe valve our topselling globe
