reliable sealing and resistancewith specially developed elastomer liners easy to automate available with manual electric pneumatic or hydraulic actuators singleoffset butterfly valve the centre of rotation of the valve disc is offset from the seat centreline but remains on the pipe centreline doubleoffset butterfly valve in addition to the above the centre of rotation is also offset from the pipe centreline tripleoffset butterfly valve in addition to both of the above the rotational axis of the seat is neither parallel nor symmetric to the pipe centreline butterfly valve with wafertype body this type is only suitable for being clamped between two flanges butterfly valve with semilug body this design enables downstream dismantling for a short time butterfly valve with usection body the throughholes and threads enable simple clamping or flanging of the valve butterfly valve with fulllug body the threads enable the valve to be easily bolted to and removed from a flange in the case of a butterfly valve clamped between flanges only pressure is applied to the body the force is transferred from flange to flange through the bolting a flanged butterfly valve additionally absorbs piping forces actuating torque of the butterfly valve lubricating or nonlubricating fluid required actuation pneumatic hydraulic or electric function openclosed or control tasks doubleacting actuators the valve is opened and closed by compressed air singleacting actuators the compressed air only operates the valve in one direction while loading a spring stack in the other direction the recovery forces of the springs actuate the valve singleacting actuators can either be closed by spring force or opened by spring force actuators that are closed or opened by spring force move the valve disc into the required failsafe position if the air supply fails epdm resistant to heat chemicals hot water nbr resistant to fuels mineral oils lubricating greases vegetable or animal fats oils water
