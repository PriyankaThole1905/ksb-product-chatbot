ksb sets standards worldwide with its cuttingedge robust and reliable water pumps you too can benefit from our products learn more about their benefits highefficiency pump a ksb highefficiency pump is easy on your wallet as it is particularly energysaving find out more from one of the market leaders for pumps heating pump optimised hydraulic system and integrated variable speed control modern circulators from ksb are particularly energyefficient to run learn more here lift check valve a ksb lift check valve reliably prevents any backflow of the fluid and with that drainage of the suction line between pump and inlet in this way your pump will always be ready for operation centrifugal pump centrifugal pumps from ksb offer a stable operation even at large flow rates this is why they are especially popular in industry find out more pump control unit a reliable pump control unit is indispensable for the demanddriven operation of a pump ksb offers electronic pump control units for the highest of efficiency and reliability when handling fluids in industry and building services applications grey water pump transport treat and dispose of waste water efficiently with ksbs grey water and waste water pumps we offer individual pumps for private households and industry butterfly valve proven track record ksbs butterfly valves have been a success story for more than 50 years offering a diverse range of technical benefits butterfly valves find widespread use globe valve operating reliability and energy efficiency are characteristic features of ksbs globe valve type series being optimally suited for insulation the valves markedly minimise heat losses in industrial processes and technical procedures the globe valves are completely maintenancefree ball valve a high pressure capability an excellent shutoff low maintenance a ball valve from ksb is a reliable valve for gases oils hydrocarbons and other noncorrosive fluids waste water lifting unit ksb waste water and grey water lifting units take optimum care of draining waste water of all types without any risk of backflow read more about the benefits of these units gate valve ksb gate valves for reliably shutting off liquids gases and vapours in piping systems for use in industry water energy and building services applications well pump ksbs well pumps and deep well pumps are based on the proven quality of ksbs submersible borehole pumps pumps ksb pumps are operating worldwide in industry building services water and energy applications also covering all fields of automation and drives mechanical seals ksbs mechanical seals for pumps reliably seal the passage of the rotating shaft through a centrifugal pumps casing the seals make sure that the fluid handled can not escape from the inside of the pump or only in very small amounts strainers in heating systems airconditioning systems or industrial plants a ksb strainer not only prevents contamination or damage caused by solids it also clearly reduces the regular servicing and cleaning work required for your system balancing valves in heating systems airconditioning systems or cooling circuits with a balancing valve from ksb the volume flow rate in the piping system can be optimally controlled thus preventing oversupply or undersupply of individual consumer installations inline pumps high performance small footprint and flexible installation options inline pumps from ksb find out more highpressure pump ksbs highpressure pumps are versatile in use typical examples are pressure booster and irrigation systems find out more here pressure booster systems pressure booster systems and pumps from ksb increase supply pressure in an optimum and efficient way find the right pressure booster system for your application rainwater pump
