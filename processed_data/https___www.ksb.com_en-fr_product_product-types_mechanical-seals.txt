the seal faces of the sealing rings are pressed to each other by hydraulic and mechanical forces one of them is connected with the rotating pump shaft the other with the pump casing the flexibility of the springloaded seal also compensates for axial or radial movement of the drive shaft to some extent a lubricating film in the sealing clearance of the mechanical seal between the two seal faces influences the mechanical seal function considerably the distance between the two faces also referred to as the clearance gap width depends on several factors for example the surface quality of the seal faces the pressure to be sealed off and the sliding velocity by reducing friction between the seal faces as much as possible the liquid film between the seal faces prevents wear as a matter of design a very small amount of the fluid handled always escapes at a mechanical seal experts call it leakage in the case of wellfunctioning mechanical seals this leakage of the fluid handled is usually invisible to the naked eye or evaporates shortly before leaving the sealing gap escaping to atmosphere if a pump visibly loses some of the fluid handled this is often a sign of advanced wear or of the seal already being defective mechanical seals wear out faster in pumps that handle fluids containing solids such as waste water the reason abrasive grinding substances attack the material there is a danger of particles entering the sealing clearance and causing premature wear of the seal faces over time the solid particles deposit and block the springs as well as the moveability of the seal unit this shortens the service life the mechanical seal will start leaking earlier with large amounts of the fluid handled escaping from inside the pump schematic of a ksb mechanical seal to prevent damage caused by wear pump operators often supply the mechanical seal area with a clean flushing fluid or barrier fluid the barrier fluid stops abrasive solid particles from reaching the seal faces it is also called the supply fluid depending on the application the fluid fulfils different tasks it may serve to cool heat or lubricate the mechanical seal for example or to prevent deposits pumps come in different designs selecting the right seal type depends on the sliding velocity the pressure inside the pump and the temperature of the fluid to be transported mechanical seals cover a large range of applications and fluids handled however some pumps are still fitted with different seal types even today eg with a gland packing if suitable for the place of installation and if the required service staff knowhow can be provided this seal type is still an option even though it is no longer state of the art mechanical seals have proven to be wellsuited for low pressure and high pressure as well as for different circumferential speeds the sealing clearance of the mechanical seal is at a right angle to the shaft axis major advantages the mechanical seal has got over other seals are its compact design low friction loss ease of service and low leakage unlike other sealing systems mechanical seals are also suitable for variable speed pumps a benefit that is not to be underestimated considering environmental protection costs and energy efficiency the ideal seal is often closely linked with the application of the corresponding pump a perfect design and the use of optimum materials for seal casing and shaft are just as important as many years of experience in the field of pumps ksb mechanical seals are characterised by their design being optimised for the corresponding ksb pump ksb offers its customers a sealing concept tailored to the geometric and hydraulic properties of the pump a ksb mechanical seal unites the following core characteristics most pump failures are caused by a defective mechanical seal this is why an optimum mechanical seal should be chosen early on together with the pump as a fullrange supplier ksb provides the knowhow and service required for the entire pump system with mechanical seals for standard applications and api applications ksb offers its customers highly advanced seals and supply systems optimised for use in ksb pumps in addition to technical advantages a mechanical seal from ksb also has economic advantages for example mechanical seals are also referred to as axial or hydrodynamic shaft seals other types of shaft seals are the mechanical seal is a dynamic seal and belongs to the subcategory of rotational seals the opposite would be static seals such as mechanical seals from ksb for a large range of applications with ksbs
