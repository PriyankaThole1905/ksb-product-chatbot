efficiencya variable speed circulator by ksb offers the highest overall efficiencies with an energy efficiency index eei of 023 highly resistant to pressure and wear the volute casing is made of grey cast iron with cathodic ecoating also called cataphoretic coating for drinking water pumps the volute casing is made of stainless steel the can is also generally made of stainless steel maintenancefree designfora long service lifeby using maintenancefree bearings clearlylowered noise emissionwith adjusted operating mode and low head easy to start up also after prolonged shutdown periodswith special deblocking and venting function low water consumptionwarm water is available as soon as the tap is opened which prevents unused cold water from going down the drain minimised risk of legionella contaminationby water being circulated in the piping rather than being stagnant with special impellers for liquidgas mixtures or suspensions with sealing systems incorporating gas cushions or meeting other special requirements of nuclear reactor technology with heating devices for liquids which solidify rapidly with protective lining preventing erosion in explosionproof design a temperature sensor for starting up the pump when the return temperature is too low this is how the water is recirculated a lift check valve preventing circulation by gravity a timer for making hot water available immediately at certain times only combining a circulator with a timer makes sense as the circulation should be limited to what is actually needed otherwise energy will be wasted during the night or when residents are away an integrated control system can prevent this from happening heating ventilation airconditioning and cooling systems drinking water systems general circulation
