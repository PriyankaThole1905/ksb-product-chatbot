in heating systems airconditioning systems or industrial plants a ksb strainer not only prevents contamination or damage caused by solids it also clearly reduces the regular servicing and cleaning work required for your system strainers from ksb are available in various material variants and mesh sizes as well as according to different standards their ypattern body and optimised flow path enable higher flow rates with lower pressure losses in the system strainers belong to the category of check valves the strainer consists of a valve body and filters gases or liquids flowing through an integral screen made of stainless steel this ensures that piping and pumps remain free of contamination and prevents damage to the system caused by foreign matter commercially obtainable strainers are available in the body and filter types t w and y strainer to ansiasme with flanged ends ypattern bolted cover cast steel a216 wcb screen made of stainless steel 304 mesh width 15 mm strainer to dinen with flanged ends with standard or fine screen all nominal sizes with drain plug in the cover made of grey cast iron or nodular cast iron strainer to dinen with flanged ends fsl or butt weld ends fss made of cast steel with standard or fine screen all nominal sizes with drain plug in the cover optional magnetic insert ksb strainers are used for the most diverse of applications our strainers with a stainless steel body are also suitable for use in pump systems handling corrosive or aggressive fluids overview of ksb strainer applications ksb strainers optimum protection of your systems reliable
