With KSB SuPremE, a magnetless synchronous reluctance motor (exception: motor sizes 0.55 kW / 0.75 kW with 1500 rpm are designed with permanent magnets) of efficiency class IE4/IE5 to IEC TS 60034-30-2:2016, for operation on a KSB PumpDrive 2 or KSB PumpDrive 2 Eco variable speed system without rotor position sensors. Motor mounting points in accordance with EN 50347, envelope dimensions in accordance with DIN V 42673 (07-2011). ATEX-compliant version available.
Multistage vertical high-pressure immersion pump for installation on tanks or platforms.
Multistage horizontal or vertical centrifugal pump in ring-section design, long-coupled or close-coupled, with axial or radial suction nozzle, cast radial impellers and motor-mounted variable speed system. ATEX-compliant version available.
Fully automatic pressure booster system with two to three (MVP) / four (SVP) vertical high-pressure pumps in two variable speed versions. The MVP and SVP variable speed versions ensure variable speed control of each pump by motor-mounted frequency inverter for asynchronous motors (MVP) or by PumpDrive variable speed system and KSB SuPremE motor (SVP), respectively, providing fully electronic control to ensure the required supply pressure. Equipped with a central fuse box.
Fully automatic package pressure booster system with two to three (VC) / four (F/SVP) vertical high-pressure pumps; available in cascade-controlled and two variable speed designs. Cascade control (F) for ensuring the required supply pressure. The VC and SVP versions ensure variable speed control of each pump by cabinet-mounted frequency inverter (VC) or motor-mounted PumpDrive variable speed system and KSB SuPremE motor (SVP), respectively, providing fully electronic control to ensure the required supply pressure. Automated with KSB BoosterCommand Pro.
Horizontal radially split multistage high-pressure pumps in between-bearings design, with double casing (barrel-type pumps) to API 610 (ISO 13709), type BB5. First stage optionally available in double-suction design for low NPSH requirements. ATEX-compliant version available.
Horizontal radially split ring-section pump with radial impellers, single-entry or double-entry, multistage.
Horizontal radially split product-lubricated multistage ring-section pump with radial impellers, axial and radial single-entry inlet.
