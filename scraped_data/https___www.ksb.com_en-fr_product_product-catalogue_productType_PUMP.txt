Installed as a pump set with gear unit and standardised motor. Vitalobe is EHEDG-certified. The pump elastomers comply with the FDA standards and EN 1935/2004. Accessories include a trolley, a heatable casing or casing cover and a pressure relief arrangement. ATEX-compliant version available.
Service-friendly close-coupled side-channel pump (self-priming) with magnetless KSB SuPremE motor (exception: motor sizes 0.55 kW / 0.75 kW with 1500 rpm are designed with permanent magnets) of efficiency class IE4/IE5 and PumpDrive variable speed system. All wetted components are made of 1.4404/1.4409 (AISI 316L/CF3M) stainless steel. Hygienic design for the highest cleanability requirements (CIP/SIP-compatible). All materials comply with FDA standards and EN 1935/2004. Trolley available among other accessories. ATEX-compliant version available.
Multistage centrifugal pump in close-coupled design for vertical or horizontal installation. All wetted components are made of 1.4401/1.4408 (AISI 316/CF8M) stainless steel. Versatile, robust and especially energy-efficient. CIP/SIP-compatible. All materials comply with FDA standards and EN 1935/2004. Trolley also available among other accessories.
Patented design with state-of-the-art hydraulic system and highly wear-resistant materials for high-pressure applications. The pump casing is designed to withstand maximum stresses, e.g. during pressure surges.
Vertically suspended, single-casing, lineshaft, diffuser-type pump with integral thrust bearings and discharge through column pipe in accordance with API 610 / ISO 13709 (VS1). Available in single-stage and multistage configurations and with either single or double suction first-stage impeller.
Vertical, multistage, barrel pull-out ring-section pump for underground installation on a base frame in the pump sump, radial impellers, single-entry suction impellers, flanges to DIN or ANSI.
Vertical can-type ring-section pump, radial and mixed flow hydraulic system, single-entry and multi-entry impellers
Vertical can-type ring-section pump on base frame, multistage, first-stage impeller designed as a double-entry suction impeller, radial impellers. Flanges to DIN or ANSI.
Vertically suspended, double-casing, lineshaft, diffuser-type pump with integral thrust bearings and discharge through column pipe in accordance with API 610 / ISO 13709 (VS6). Available in single-stage or multistage configurations and with single suction first-stage impeller.
Horizontal radially split single-stage double-entry boiler feed booster pump (booster system) with cast steel single or double volute casing.
Double-entry vertical shaft submersible pump in cantilever design with bearings arranged outside of the fluid handled. Double-entry pump design enables handling of fluids with a high solids content without leaving any residues. Wear parts of wetted pump components (casing, impeller, shaft-end plate / liner) made of white cast iron with a high chromium content and therefore very wear-resistant. Perfectly suited for transporting fluids containing hardly to slightly abrasive solids. Ideal for sludges, classes 1 to 2.
