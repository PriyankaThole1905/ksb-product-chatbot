In industrial processes and technical procedures enormous heat losses can occur quickly. Poorly insulated or uninsulated pipe fittings such as globe valves can become the weak point of your system. In large plants, heat loss multiplies as often thousands of globe valves are installed in such facilities.
Operating reliability and energy efficiency are characteristic features of KSB globe valves. Being optimally suited for insulation, the valves minimise heat loss in industrial processes and technical procedures, regardless of whether the fluid flowing through the globe valve is water or a different fluid. KSB globe valves are completely maintenance-free.
Globe valve to DIN/EN with flanged ends, short face-to-face length to EN 558/14, slanted seat design with vertical bonnet, single-piece body, EPDM-encapsulated throttling plug, soft main and back seat, position indicator, locking device, travel stop, insulating cap with anti-condensation feature; maintenance-free, full insulation possible.
Globe valve to ANSI/ASME with threaded sockets (NPT) or socket weld ends (SW), cast steel/stainless steel body, trim and bellows made of stainless steel, outside screw and yoke, sealed by graphite gland packing and metal bellows, stainless steel/graphite gaskets.
Bellows-type globe valve to DIN/EN with flanged ends (ZXLBV), butt weld ends or socket weld ends (ZXSBV), tapered on/off disc or throttling plug, two-piece stem, integrated position indicator, seat/disc interface made of wear and corrosion resistant chrome steel or chrome nickel steel.
Globe valves serve to shut off the flow of liquid or gaseous fluids in pipes. They can also be used as control valves. For shutting off the flow, the stem rotates and presses the valve disc against the valve seat. For many conventional globe valves, the yoke also serves as a type of cooling rib, leading to low temperatures at the handwheel.
The secret behind KSB globe valves? It's simple: We combine an easy-to-insulate basic geometry with suitable materials to reduce the flow of heat. To this effect, we use a heat barrier connected with the handwheel. The stem nut and the handwheel are made of poorly heat-conducting materials. This reduces the thermal conductivity by 75 percent compared to the previous design.
