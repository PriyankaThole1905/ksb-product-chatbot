Bespoke, individual, comprehensive: KSB provides professional valve service for all makes – regardless of the design, size and manufacturer.
KSB offers the right valve for every application. Alongside globe valves, gate valves, butterfly valves, ball valves, diaphragm valves and control valves, the industrial valve product range also includes actuators, positioners and strainers.
KSB also offers all components for the hydraulic balancing of heating, ventilation and air-conditioning systems: from static balancing valves and differential pressure regulators to pressure-independent control valves.
Centred-disc butterfly valve with ISO 5211 compliant square shaft end, sealed by elastomer liner, with lever or manual gearbox, pneumatic, electric or hydraulic actuator. Wafer-type body (T1), semi-lug body (T2), full-lug body (T4) or U-section body with flat faces (T5). Body types T2 and T4 are suitable for downstream dismantling and dead-end service with counterflange. Connections to EN, ASME, JIS.
Bellows-type globe valve to DIN/EN with flanged ends, with on/off disc or throttling plug, standard position indicator with colour coding for identification of valve design, replaceable valve disc; bellows protected when valve is in fully open position; seat/disc interface made of wear and corrosion resistant chrome steel or chrome nickel steel.
Bellows-type globe valve to DIN/EN with flanged ends (ZYLB) or butt weld ends (ZYSB), Y-pattern, with replaceable throttling plug (up to DN 100) or on/off disc (DN 125 and above), single-piece non-rotating stem, position indicator, travel stop, locking device; seat/disc interface made of wear and corrosion resistant chrome steel or chrome nickel steel.
Service-friendly control valve to DIN/EN with flanged ends, either with linear or equal-percentage control characteristic at Kvs values of 0.1 to 630 m³/h and closing pressures of up to 40 bar; all internal parts are easy to replace without special tools, including the reversible seat; noise level reduced by standard two-stage pressure reduction combining a parabolic plug and multi-hole cage; with electric actuator.
Weir-type diaphragm valve to DIN/EN with flanged ends, threaded socket ends or socket weld ends, in straight-way pattern; shut-off and sealing to atmosphere by supported and confined diaphragm; body with coating or lining, position indicator with integrated stem protection. All moving parts are separated from the fluid by the diaphragm. Maintenance-free.
Balancing, measurement and shut-off valve with flanged ends to DIN/EN, constant measurement accuracy independent of differential pressures. Body in standard face-to-face length to EN 558/1, throttling plug, scaled position indicator, travel stop and insulating cap with anti-condensation feature; maintenance-free, full insulation possible. Also available with electrostatic plastic coating (EKB) and DVGW-certified for drinking water. With integrated  ultrasonic sensors not coming into contact with the fluid handled. Stationary monitoring by means of BOATRONIC 100 MOD (24 V AC/DC, Modbus) of flow direction, volume flow rate and temperature, and optional  recording of supply and return temperature as well as thermal output and quantity of heat. Mobile measurement of flow direction, volume flow rate and temperature using the BOATRONIC MS (battery powered) / BOATRONIC 100 (rechargeable battery powered) measuring computers.
Centred-disc butterfly valve with ISO 5211 compliant square shaft end, sealed by elastomer liner, with lever or manual gearbox, pneumatic, electric or hydraulic actuator. Wafer-type body (T1), semi-lug body (T2), full-lug body (T4) or U-section body with flat faces (T5). Body types T2 and T4 are suitable for downstream dismantling and dead-end service with counterflange. Connections to EN, ASME, JIS.
Globe valve to DIN/EN with flanged ends (ZXL), butt weld ends or socket weld ends (ZXS), with gland packing, with on/off disc or throttling plug, rotating stem, seat/disc interface made of wear and corrosion resistant 17 % chrome steel or Stellite.
Service-friendly control valve to DIN/EN with flanged ends, either with linear or equal-percentage control characteristic at Kvs values of 0.1 to 630 m³/h and closing pressures of up to 40 bar; all internal parts are easy to replace without special tools, including the reversible seat; noise level reduced by standard two-stage pressure reduction combining a parabolic plug and multi-hole cage; with electric actuator.

By continuously expanding our portfolio ofautomation solutions for valveswe respond to current requirements regarding communication, energy efficiency and life cycle costs. KSB offers a comprehensive range of intelligent positioners and control units designed to handle process data, to control valves and improve their control accuracy.
The key elements of our valves are all developed, manufactured and continuously enhanced in-house, such as theelastomer materials for valve diaphragms or liners.
The materials we use are developed and testedin our in-house materials laboratoryand in cooperation with research institutes for materials science and materials engineering.
Our owncompetence centre for welding technologyensures optimum processing of valve bodies and mechanical components.
Valves with a flow-optimised geometry, such as our globe valves in slanted-seat design, with theirlow zeta values reduce pressure lossesin your system.
