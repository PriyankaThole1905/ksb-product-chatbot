Globe valve
Operating reliability and energy efficiency are characteristic features of KSB's globe valve type series. Being optimally suited for insulation, the valves markedly minimise heat losses in industrial processes and technical procedures. The globe valves are completely maintenance-free.
Ball valve
A high pressure capability, an excellent shut-off, low maintenance – a ball valve from KSB is a reliable valve for gases, oils, hydrocarbons and other non-corrosive fluids.
Waste water lifting unit
KSB waste water and grey water lifting units take optimum care of draining waste water of all types without any risk of backflow. Read more about the benefits of these units.
Gate valve
KSB gate valves for reliably shutting off liquids, gases and vapours in piping systems For use in industry, water, energy and building services applications.
Well pump
KSB’s well pumps and deep well pumps are based on the proven quality of KSB’s submersible borehole pumps.
Pumps
KSB pumps are operating worldwide in industry, building services, water and energy applications, also covering all fields of automation and drives.
Mechanical seals
KSB’s mechanical seals for pumps reliably seal the passage of the rotating shaft through a centrifugal pump's casing. The seals make sure that the fluid handled cannot escape from the inside of the pump – or only in very small amounts.
Strainers
In heating systems, air-conditioning systems or industrial plants: A KSB strainer not only prevents contamination or damage caused by solids, it also clearly reduces the regular servicing and cleaning work required for your system.
Balancing valves
In heating systems, air-conditioning systems or cooling circuits: With a balancing valve from KSB the volume flow rate in the piping system can be optimally controlled, thus preventing oversupply or undersupply of individual consumer installations.
In-line pumps
High performance, small footprint and flexible installation options: in-line pumps from KSB. Find out more.
High-pressure pump
KSB’s high-pressure pumps are versatile in use. Typical examples are pressure booster and irrigation systems. Find out more here.
Pressure booster systems
Pressure booster systems and pumps from KSB increase supply pressure in an optimum and efficient way. Find the right pressure booster system for your application.
