To manage your fluids, you can choose not only pumps but also valves from KSB, the manufacturer of pumps and valves.
A valve is either open or closed. But as simple as this may sound, the technology involved is becoming increasingly complex in order to meet requirements in terms of service life, precision and value for money.
