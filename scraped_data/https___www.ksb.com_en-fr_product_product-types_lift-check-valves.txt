Thecombined non-return / shut-off valvecombines the functions of the shut-off valve and the non-return valve.
Ball check valvesfeature a ball as the obturator. Their design makes them particularly suitable for use in waste water and water pumping systems.
Theautomatic recirculation valveis there to maintain a minimum flow rate downstream of boiler feed pumps in the event of low flow operation – i.e. the minimum flow rate that must be available in order to avoid impermissible temperature rises in the pump.
Other special types of lift check valves aresafety valvesandby-pass valves. In these valves, a spring- or weight-loaded plug opens at a specific overpressure to relieve the system.
Compared with swing check valves, lift check valves have higher head losses, as the deflection of the flow is much more significant. Lift check valves are therefore used mainly for smaller nominal diameters, i.e. for pipes with smaller diameters or valves with small mating dimensions.
KSB's spring-loaded lift check valves can be fitted in the piping in almost any installation position.
In addition, lift check valves can prevent water hammer in the condensate pipe caused by backflow of steam. Seat/disc interfaces made of wear- and corrosion-resistant materials, such as 17 percent chrome steel or stellite, make for a long service life and high functional reliability of these valves.
