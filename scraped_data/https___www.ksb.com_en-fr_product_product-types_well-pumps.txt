Products
Maximum flow rate at optimum energy efficiencyalso for extreme requirements
Durable, maintenance-free and corrosion-resistantwith particularly wear-resistant materials
Maintenance-free enclosed pump bearingsprevent the ingress of sand and abrasive wear.
Protection against wear in clearancesby casing wear rings made of wear and corrosion-resistant metal
Fastening elements made of stainless steel:All screws, nuts and bolts in contact with the fluid handled are made of CrNiMo steel. They are easy to remove and fit even after years of use.
Protected pump shaft:Impeller hubs and sleeves protect the stainless steel shaft against wear caused by the fluid handled.
Outstanding service life and excellent efficiencies
Low energy and life cycle costs
High operating reliabilityand protection against water hammer
Suitable for drinking water:All wetted components have been tested for use with drinking water. They meet the most stringent of drinking water requirements.
Altered operating conditions (e.g. supply network expansion due to the connection of a new housing estate)
Changes in the groundwater level
Ochre build-up in the system
Worn pump
Changes to the pipeline or downstream water treatment systems
Changes to the well inflow zone over time (gravel screens/filters etc.)
