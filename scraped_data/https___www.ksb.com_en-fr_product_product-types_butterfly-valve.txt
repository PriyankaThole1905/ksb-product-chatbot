Single-offset butterfly valve: The centre of rotation of the valve disc is offset from the seat centreline but remains on the pipe centreline.
Double-offset butterfly valve: In addition to the above, the centre of rotation is also offset from the pipe centreline.
Triple-offset butterfly valve: In addition to both of the above, the rotational axis of the seat is neither parallel nor symmetric to the pipe centreline.
Butterfly valve with wafer-type body: This type is only suitable for being clamped between two flanges.
Butterfly valve with semi-lug body: This design enables downstream dismantling for a short time.
Butterfly valve with U-section body: The throughholes and threads enable simple clamping or flanging of the valve.
Butterfly valve with full-lug body: The threads enable the valve to be easily bolted to and removed from a flange. In the case of a butterfly valve clamped between flanges, only pressure is applied to the body; the force is transferred from flange to flange through the bolting. A flanged butterfly valve additionally absorbs piping forces.
Actuating torque of the butterfly valve
Lubricating or non-lubricating fluid
Required actuation: pneumatic, hydraulic or electric
Function: open/closed or control tasks
Double-acting actuators: The valve is opened and closed by compressed air.
Single-acting actuators: The compressed air only operates the valve in one direction while loading a spring stack. In the other direction, the recovery forces of the springs actuate the valve. Single-acting actuators can either be closed by spring force or opened by spring force. Actuators that are closed or opened by spring force move the valve disc into the required fail-safe position if the air supply fails.
EPDM: resistant to heat, chemicals, hot water
NBR: resistant to fuels, mineral oils, lubricating greases, vegetable or animal fats, oils, water, drilling emulsions
Viton®: resistant to oil and chemicals, high heat resistance, high resistance to ozone, ageing and weather, high flame retardancy, low gas permeability
Hypalon®: resistant to chemicals (especially to fluids with an oxidising effect)
Silicone: resistant to heat, ozone, ageing and chemicals (almost unchanged mechanical properties over the entire temperature range)
Epichlorhydrin: resistant to mineral oil, weather and ozone
HNBR: resistant to oil and petrol. Like NBR but with a higher resistance to temperature, ageing and weather (physical properties also at high temperatures)
Nitrile,carboxylated: resistant to abrasion, pneumatic transport of solids, also suitable for the food processing industry
PFA (Teflon®) perfluoroalkoxy copolymer: properties similar to PTFE but with a denser structure, resistant to chemicals (almost all organic and inorganic chemicals)
