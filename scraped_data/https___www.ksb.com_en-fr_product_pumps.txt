Comprehensive services, all from a single source
We focus on our customers' precise requirements. More than 150 years of experience combined with ourpassion for technological progress and innovationhave resulted in pumps meeting the highest of quality demands.
It is very useful for us in this regard to be presentworldwide in all relevant markets with our own factories and development departments. Our sales and service personnel are always close to the customer and therefore know first-hand what exactly each market needs. In addition to quality, long service life and energy efficiency, it is often individualised solutions and services that make the difference.
State-of-the-art production and materials technologies enable us to develophighly specialised tailor-made solutions. By using additive manufacturing we can produce complex components and small series. 3D printing also allows us to supply spare parts fast, even for pumps made by other manufacturers.
In the operation and maintenance of our pumps our customers benefit fromthe latest digital technologies. Our KSB Guard, MyFlow Technology and KSB Sonolyzer solutions monitor a system’s operation online, ensuring reliability, maximum efficiency and a minimum of unscheduled downtimes.
