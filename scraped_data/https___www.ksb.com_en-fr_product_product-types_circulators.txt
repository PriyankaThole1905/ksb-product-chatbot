KSB circulators are used wherever energy-efficient supply systems are required. Without being reliably supplied with clean water, ventilation and air-conditioning many buildings can hardly be used, let alone lived in.

Outstanding energy efficiency:A variable speed circulator by KSB offers the highest overall efficiencies with an energy efficiency index (EEI) of ≤ 0.23
Highly resistant to pressure and wear: The volute casing is made of grey cast iron with cathodic E-coating (also called cataphoretic coating). For drinking water pumps the volute casing is made of stainless steel. The can is also generally made of stainless steel.
Maintenance-free designfora long service lifeby using maintenance-free bearings
Clearlylowered noise emissionwith adjusted operating mode and low head
Easy to start up also after prolonged shutdown periodswith special deblocking and venting function
Low water consumption:Warm water is available as soon as the tap is opened, which prevents unused cold water from going down the drain.
Minimised risk of legionella contaminationby water being circulated in the piping rather than being stagnant
With special impellers for liquid/gas mixtures or suspensions
With sealing systems incorporating gas cushions or meeting other special requirements of nuclear reactor technology
With heating devices for liquids which solidify rapidly
With protective lining preventing erosion
In explosion-proof design
A temperature sensor for starting up the pump when the return temperature is too low. This is how the water is recirculated.
A lift check valve preventing circulation by gravity.
A timer for making hot water available immediately at certain times only.
Combining a circulator with a timer makes sense as the circulation should be limited to what is actually needed. Otherwise energy will be wasted during the night or when residents are away. An integrated control system can prevent this from happening.
